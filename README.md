# Python Fundamentals (also called "Core Python" and "Introduction to Python")

## Knowledge Transfer: The point of this is to help instructors who have never taught this before understand the class and the audience, etc.

### Audience
* The intended audience is that same as it would for an "Introduction to Java", "Introduction to Go", etc. That is, the intended audience is folks who know how to code in at least one other language and want to "laterally" apply those skills to Python.
* However, this course–because it's taught in Python–is often mistaken for a "learn to code" course.
* As such students in this course often have either no programming background, or a background in Bash, PowerShell, or SQL. I think we can agree those are not bona fide programming languages, and therefore, if that is their only background, they really need a course like "Introduction to Programming" (probably should be renamed "Learn to Code").
* But as an instructor who is tasked with teaching this course, you can't really die on that hill. You can suggest that folks w/o the appropriate background consider the "Introduction to Programming" course, but that doesn't mean they have to listen.
* Bottom line is that it's likely you'll have a mix of backgrounds–some folks will be developers who know Java or JavaScript, etc., and others will not have a programming background or will be DevOps-type folks with a bit of scripting under their belts.

### Teaching the Course
* Any course where there are students at differing levels will be difficult. The goal is to find the sweet spot. In the unlikely (but possible) event that all students are expecting an Intro to Programming course, then you should teach that. Ensure you have access to those materials.
* More likely, you'll have two groups, and you'll want to be mindful of that. Some exercises have "extra" parts that can be assigned to the more advanced students and the beginners can skip it. You can also assign additional work for the more advanced students, or sometimes pair them up with a less advanced counterpart (easier for an ILT than a VILT).
* If there are more advanced students then apologize to the ones with a lesser background and move at a faster pace. Let the beginners know you will help them at breaks and after class and also remind them of Intro to Programming.
* If there are more beginners, then do the opposite. Your goal is to satsify as many of the students as you can, not necessarily follow the outline
* Someone is bound to be unhappy and may well complain about it. That's OK, it's how we get these disparities fixed on the client side. Once they see the "wrong" people are signing up, they'll be more open to discussions about how to fix.

### Python 2 vs. 3
* This course used to contain a section about Python 2 vs. 3, and at various points during the course, I'd discuss 2 vs. 3 differences. That section has been removed and I'd recommend only speaking about 2 vs. 3 if students indicate it's a concern. Some teams still have Python 2 codebases, for example.
